% Motivation
\chapter{Motivation}
The motivation behind developing MeetWise stems from the increasing demand for efficient remote technical assessment tools in the modern recruitment landscape. With the global shift towards remote work, there's a growing need for platforms that can facilitate technical interviews without compromising on quality.

Traditional technical interviews often involve cumbersome setups, including separate video conferencing tools and code sharing platforms, leading to disjointed experiences and technical challenges. Additionally, existing solutions often lack specialized features required for technical interviews, such as real-time code collaboration with syntax highlighting, language-specific assessment tools, and integrated recording systems.

We identified these gaps in the market and recognized the opportunity to create a comprehensive solution that addresses these challenges. By integrating video conferencing with collaborative coding features, we aimed to create a seamless interview experience that accurately simulates real-world technical collaboration.

Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of remote hiring processes, making it essential to have robust remote assessment tools. This increased urgency motivated us to develop a solution that could meet the immediate needs of the industry while incorporating innovative features for enhanced user experience.

% Objective
\chapter{Objective}
The primary objective of the MeetWise project is to develop a comprehensive technical interview platform that streamlines the remote assessment process for both recruiters and candidates. Specifically, the project aims to:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Create a seamless integration of video conferencing and collaborative coding environment to facilitate efficient technical interviews.

    \item Implement real-time collaboration features that allow interviewers and candidates to interact with code simultaneously, enabling accurate assessment of technical skills.

    \item Develop robust security measures to protect sensitive interview data and ensure privacy compliance.
